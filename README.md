Here are descriptions of the sorting and searching algorithms mentioned on the files :

- Quicksort :  A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot, partitions the array around it, and recursively sorts the partitions. It has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n).

- Binary Search: An efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search space in half until the target value is found, giving it a time complexity of O(log n).

  Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²).

- Heap Sort: Uses a heap data structure to sort elements by repeatedly extracting the maximum or minimum element. It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

- Insertion Sort: Works by picking elements one by one and inserting them into their correct position within a growing sorted section. It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²).

- Linear Search: A basic searching algorithm that scans each element in the array sequentially until the target is found. Its time complexity is O(n).

- Optimized Bubble Sort: A variation of Bubble Sort that tracks whether swaps occur, allowing it to terminate early if the array is already sorted. The time complexity remains O(n²) but improves in best-case scenarios.

- Selection Sort: Sorts by repeatedly finding the smallest element and moving it to its correct position. It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²).
